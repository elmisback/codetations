  <h1>Codetations</h1>
  <h4>Edward Misback, University of Washington</h4>
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    Codetations are location anchors for code that allow referencing a particular location even after the code has been changed. 
    It is possible for these anchors to live separately from the code to avoid affecting the editing experience.
  </p>
  <h2>Motivation & Significance for Scholarly Communication</h2>
  <p>
    In order to talk about something, we must have a way to refer to it. When we informally discuss and think about code in an existing library, 
    we often do so at the level of code expressions, asking "what does this line do?". However, we are typically limited to describing code executions
    at the level of functions: even though one can copy a line and test it in a REPL, even if we keep track of our test somewhere, it has become independent
    of the original code. But what if we could instead persistently refer to and execute code in place at the line or expression level? 
    This would expand our ability to understand and specify how code behaves. After all, code is easiest to run and make "live" if it's just a couple of lines.
  </p>
  <p>
    Besides being generally useful for programming tools, expression-level annotation 
    has special application to fields like education and programming languages, where the meaning and behavior of individual expressions is studied carefully.
    Tools for these fields can take advantage of persistent annotation points to offer extensive commentary without interrupting the view of the code, or
    to attach expression debuggers that visualize data flowing through an expression.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the long term, execution data gathered from user interactions with annotation points might be used to understand how data flows through the program as a whole.
  </p>
  <h2>Project progress</h2>
  <p>
    I implemented a program for automatically updating stored annotation positions using diffs and anchor information 
    if the code was edited without a connection to the annotation server.
